# Modulaiton_Classification_Digital_Signal_Process
 This project explores the use of Convolutional Neu ral Networks (CNN) for modulation classification of wireless  signals using the RadioML dataset, highlighting the effectiveness  of feature engineering to improve model accuracy. Federated  Learning (FL) was further implemented to enable distributed  training while preserving privacy, demonstrating a viable ap proach for efficient and secure signal classification in wireless  networks. Results showed significant improvements in classifi cation accuracy after feature enhancement and validated the  practicality of FL for privacy-conscious scenarios.
